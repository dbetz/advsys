        INTRODUCTION

        ADVSYS is a special purpose programming language that was
        specifically designed to be used to write computer text
        adventure games.  It includes a facility for defining the kinds
        of objects that are common in adventures.  Some objects
        represent locations on the game map, some objects represent
        things that the player can find while exploring the adventure
        world, and some objects represent other characters that the
        adventurer can encounter during his or her journeys.  The
        adventure language also provides a facility to define actions.
        Actions are short sections of code that determine what happens
        in response to a command from the player.  These two concepts,
        "objects" and "actions" form the basis for the adventure
        language.


        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

        Although I have written all of the code associated with this
        adventure writing system, I must acknowledge the assistance of
        one individual without whom this project would probably never
        have reached completion.  That person is Gary McGath.  Gary was
        interested in writing a commercial quality adventure game and I
        convinced him to write it using my system (which was as yet
        almost completely unspecified) instead of using a traditional
        programming language.  The input that Gary provided during the
        development of his game contributed significantly to the overall
        design of the system.  I would like to thank Gary for that
        contribution.

        USING THE SYSTEM TO WRITE AN ADVENTURE

        In order to write an adventure using this system, you need to
        write an adventure description.  This is an ordinary ASCII text
        file containing definitions for all of the objects and actions
        in your adventure game.  This file is used as input to the
        adventure compiler.  The compiler takes the adventure
        description and compiles it into a set of data structures.

        In order to play an adventure written using this system, you
        need the data structure file that was produced by the compiler
        and the adventure interpreter program.  The interpreter uses the
        information produced by the adventure compiler to allow a player
        to play the adventure game.  Notice that it is not necessary for
        the player to have access to the original adventure description
        file.  All of the information that is necessary to play the
        adventure game is contained within the data structure file that
        is produced by the compiler.  This file is a binary file that
        cannot be simply "listed" to reveal the internal workings of the
        adventure.

        The adventure compiler is called ADVCOM and the interpreter is
        called ADVINT.  These two programs in conjunction with this
        documentation are all that is required to write and play
        adventure games using this system.

        RUNNING THE COMPILER

        If you have created an adventure definition file called
        "MYADV.ADV", you can compile it with the command:

                A>advcom myadv

        Typing this command will invoke the adventure compiler and cause
        it to compile the file named "MYADV.ADV".  The ".ADV" extension
        is added to the file name by the compiler.  During the process
        of compiling the file, many messages will be printed telling
        about the progress of the compiler.  At the end of the
        compilation process, the compiler prints a set of statistics
        describing the resulting data structure file.  This file will be
        called "MYADV.DAT".  It contains the data structures needed by
        the adventure interpreter to allow a player to play the
        adventure game.

        Note: The "A>" in the line above is the MS-DOS prompt and should
        not be typed as part of the command.


        RUNNING THE INTERPRETER

        Assuming that you have a compiled adventure data file called
        "MYADV.DAT", you can play the adventure by typing the command:

                A>advint myadv

        This command will start the adventure.  There will probably be
        some text printed at this point describing the adventure and the
        initial situation.  You will then be prompted to type a command.
        The prompt is the colon character.  The format for commands is
        described under the section about the parser.  After typing a
        command, you will be told what happened as a result of your
        command, your new situation will be described and you will begin
        the loop again.

        ADVENTURE DESCRIPTION FILE FORMAT

            All adventure description files contain a collection of
            statements.  These statements must be formed according to
            the following rules:


        The adventure definition statement:

            All adventure definitions should have an ADVENTURE
            statement.  This statement gives the name of the adventure
            and the version number of the definition file.  Each
            adventure should have a unique name.  This name is used to
            identify "saved position" files and insure that only files
            that correspond to the current adventure are restored.  The
            version number allows the author to have many versions of
            the same adventure during development and guarantee that
            "save" files from one version aren't restored into another
            version.

              (ADVENTURE name version)

          Example:

              (ADVENTURE sample 1)


        Vocabulary statements:

            These statements add words to the adventure vocabulary.

              (ADJECTIVE word*)
              (PREPOSITION word*)
              (CONJUNCTION word*)
              (ARTICLE word*)
              (SYNONYM word synonym*)

          Examples:

              (ADJECTIVE red blue)
              (CONJUNCTION and)
              (SYNONYM big large)

          Note:

              Words are also added to the vocabulary by the object
              and action definitions using the NOUN, ADJECTIVE, VERB
              and PREPOSITION statements.















        ADVSYS            An Adventure Writing System             Page 6


        Constant definition statement:

              (DEFINE name value)

          Examples:

              (DEFINE what "I don't understand what you're saying!\n")
              (DEFINE max-load 100)


        Function definition statement:

              (DEFINE (function-name [arg-name]* [&aux tmp-name*]) expr*)

          Example:

              (DEFINE (factorial n)
                (IF (< n 2)
                  1
                  (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))


        Variable definition statement:

              (VARIABLE variable-name*)

          Example:

              (VARIABLE score i j)


        Property name definition statement:

              (PROPERTY property-name*)

          Example:

              (PROPERTY weight value)

        Comments:

            Comments begin with a semi-colon and end with the end of the
            line.

          Example:

              ; this is a comment


        Include files:

            Any line that begins with a "@" causes the inclusion of
            another file.  The file name immediately follows the at-sign
            and extends to the end of the line.  Only one level of
            include is supported.

          Example:

              @basic.adv

        Handler definition statements:

              (INIT expr*)
              (UPDATE expr*)
              (BEFORE expr*)
              (AFTER expr*)
              (ERROR expr*)

          Example:

              (INIT
                (print "Welcome to the sample adventure!\n"))


        Handlers:

            All activity within an adventure game is controlled by a
            built-in handler loop.  Each of the handlers in the loop
            contains code that is provided by the adventure author.  The
            sequencing from handler to handler is provided by the
            adventure system itself.

            The first handler that is called in an adventure game is the
            INIT handler.  It prints some sort of introductory text and
            initializes all global variables in order to start the
            adventure game.

            After the INIT handler has completed, the normal loop is
            entered.  It starts with the UPDATE handler.  The UPDATE
            handler prepares for the player's next turn.  It should
            describe the player's location if it has changed since the
            last turn.  After the UPDATE handler completes, the parser
            is called.  It prompts the player for a command, parses the
            command, sets the built-in parser varaibles and exits.  Then
            the BEFORE handler is called.  It is called before the
            action associated with the command to allow the adventure
            author to inspect the parser variables before proceeding to
            the action itself.  After the BEFORE handler completes, the
            action itself is called (or whatever action is stored in the
            built-in variable $ACTION when the BEFORE handler
            completes).  When the action completes, the AFTER handler is
            called to give the author a chance to handle events that
            happen only at the end of a successful turn.  The ERROR
            handler is called when the parser detects an error.

        The parser:

            The parser handles all commands from the player.  It prompts
            the player when it is ready for a new command.  The prompt
            is the colon character.  When the player has typed a
            command, the parser breaks the command into phrases.  The
            parser recognizes the following command forms:

              [actor,] verb
              [actor,] verb dobjects
              [actor,] verb dobjects preposition iobject
              [actor,] verb iobject dobjects

            Where:

              actor             ==> a noun phrase
              verb              ==> the verb phrase (1 or 2 words)
              dobjects          ==> dobject [conjunction dobject]*
              dobject           ==> a noun phrase
              preposition       ==> a preposition
              iobject           ==> a noun phrase
              noun phrase       ==> [article] [adjective]* noun

           Examples:

              Look
              Take the red magic sword
              Take the red sword and the blue bottle
              Give the troll the red sword
              Give the red sword to the troll
              Troll, give me the sword

           Notes:

              Square brackets enclose optional phrases.  An asterisk
              indicates zero or more of the preceeding element.

              The fourth form above is treated as if the player had
              typed:

                [actor,] verb dobject "to" iobject

            Once the parser has broken the command into phrases, it
            assigns each noun phrase a number.  It stores the number of
            the actor noun phrase in the built-in variable $ACTOR.  It
            stores the first direct object noun phrase number in the
            variable $DOBJECT.  It stores the number of direct objects
            in the variable $NDOBJECTS.  It stores the indirect object
            noun phrase number in the variable $IOBJECT.  If any of the
            noun phrases is missing from the command, the corresponding
            variable is set to NIL.  The parser saves the verb phrase
            and preposition to use when determining which action to use
            to handle the command.

        Action definition statement:

            Actions are used to handle player commands.  Each time the
            parser finishes parsing a new command, it uses the verb
            phrase and the preposition to locate an action to handle the
            command.  Each action specifies a kind of template that must
            match the command in order for the action to be called.  The
            template consists of the words used in the verb phrase and
            preposition and the existance of the actor, direct object
            and indirect object noun phrases.  Once the parser finds an
            action that matches the command, it stores the action in the
            built-in variable $ACTION and exits.

              (ACTION action-name astat*)
                  astat:
                      (ACTOR [flag])
                      (VERB verb*)
                      (DIRECT-OBJECT [flag])
                      (PREPOSITION word*)
                      (INDIRECT-OBJECT [flag])
                  flag:
                      REQUIRED  must have the corresponding np
                      OPTIONAL  may have the corresponding np
                      FORBIDDEN must not have the corresponding np
                  verb:
                      word
                      (word word)

          Example:

              (ACTION take
                (VERB take (pick up))
                (DIRECT-OBJECT)
                (CODE
                  (print "You can't take the ")
                  (print-noun $dobject)
                  (print "!\n")))

            If the ACTOR, DIRECT-OBJECT or INDIRECT-OBJECT statements
            are left out entirely, the settings of the corresponding
            flags are taken from the action default definitions.  If
            there is no action default definition, the value FORBIDDEN
            is assumed.  If any of these statements is present, but no
            flag is specified, it is treated as if the flag REQUIRED was
            specified.

        Action default definition statement:

            This statement defines default values for the ACTOR, DIRECT-

        Object definition statements:

            The object definition statements are used to define
            individual objects and classes of objects.  The most basic
            way of defining an object is using the (OBJECT ...)
            statement.  This defines an object which has no parent
            class.

            It is also possible to create a class of objects that share
            information.  A class is defined just like a normal object.
            It is given nouns, adjectives and properties.  In addition,
            a class may have class properties.  These are properties
            that are shared amongst all instances of the class.  In
            order to create an instance of a class, the (class-name ...)
            form is used.  This creates an instance of the named class.
            An instance will inherit all nouns and adjectives from its
            parent class.  It will also inherit all class properties
            defined in the parent (and its parents).  Any normal
            properties defined in the parent class will be copied to the
            new object.  The copies will have the same values that the
            parent has, but it is possible for the instance to have
            property definitions that override these values.  Instances
            may also have additional nouns, adjectives and properties.

              (OBJECT object-name ostat*)
              (class-name object-name ostat*)
                  ostat:
                      (NOUN word*)
                      (ADJECTIVE word*)
                      (PROPERTY [property-name value]*)
                      (CLASS-PROPERTY [property-name value]*)
                      (METHOD (selector [arg-name]* [&aux tmp-name*])
                          expr*)
                  class-name:
                      the name of a previously defined object

          Examples:

              (OBJECT sword
                (NOUN sword weapon)
                (CLASS-PROPERTY

                  value 5

        Expressions:

              (+ expr expr)     add
              (- expr expr)     subtract
              (* expr expr)     multiply
              (/ expr expr)     divide
              (% expr expr)     remainder

              (& expr expr)     bit-wise and
              (| expr expr)     bit-wise or
              (~ expr)          bit-wise complement

            These arithmetic functions operate on integers.  As it turns
            out, every data type in the system is represented by an
            integer, so these functions will work with any type of
            arguments.  They are probably only useful with integers,
            however.

              (RANDOMIZE)       reset the random number generator
              (RAND expr)       generate a random number

            These functions enable the generation of pseudo-random
            numbers.  The (RAND n) function takes a single argument and
            generates a random number between zero and n-1.  (RANDOMIZE)
            resets the seed used by the random number function so that
            each invocation of a program results in a new sequence of
            random numbers.

              (AND expr*)       logical and (short circuits)
              (OR expr*)        logical or (short circuits)
              (NOT expr)        logical not

            These functions operate on logical values.  In this system,
            any value that is not equal to NIL (or zero) is considered
            true.  NIL and zero are considered false.  AND and OR
            evaluate their arguments from left to right and stop as soon
            as the value of the entire expression can be determined.  In
            other words, AND stops when it encounters a false value, OR
            stops when it encounters a true value.

              (< expr expr)     less than
              (= expr expr)     equal to
              (> expr expr)     greater than

            These functions compare integers.  They cannot be used to
            compare strings.

              (GETP obj property-name)          get the value of a property
              (SETP obj property-name value)    set the value of a property

            These functions manipulate object properties.  They are used
            to find the value of a property or to set the value of a
            property.  They will also find and set the values of
            inherited properties.  If GETP is used to find the value of
            a property that doesn't exist for the specified object, NIL
            is returned.  If SETP is used to set the value of a property
            that doesn't exist, the operation is ignored.

              (CLASS obj)

            This function returns the class of an object.  If the object
            was defined with an (OBJECT ...) statement, NIL will be
            returned.  If the object was defined with the (class-name
            ...) statement, the class object will be returned.

              (MATCH obj noun-phrase-number)

            This function matches an object with a noun phrase.  An
            object matches a noun phrase if it includes all of the
            adjectives specified in the noun phrase and also includes
            the noun mentioned.  Both nouns and adjectives can be
            inherited.

              (YES-OR-NO)       get a yes or no answer from the player

            This function waits for the player to type a line.  If the
            line begins with a 'Y' or a 'y', the function returns T.  If
            the line begins with anything else, the function returns
            NIL.

              (PRINT expr)                      print a string
              (PRINT-NUMBER expr)               print a number
              (PRINT-NOUN noun-phrase-number)   print a noun phrase
              (TERPRI)                          terminate the print line

            These functions perform various sorts of output.  PRINT
            prints strings, PRINT-NUMBER prints numbers and PRINT-NOUN
            prints a noun phrase.

              (FINISH)          exit and continue with the AFTER handler
              (CHAIN)           exit and continue with the next handler
              (ABORT)           exit and continue with the UPDATE handler
              (RESTART)         exit and restart the current game
              (EXIT)            exit to the operating system

            These functions cause the immediate termination of the
            current handler.  FINISH causes execution to proceed with
            the AFTER handler, CHAIN causes execution to proceed with
            the next handler in the normal sequence, ABORT causes
            execution to proceed with the UPDATE handler (effectively
            aborting the current turn), RESTART restores the game to its









        ADVSYS            An Adventure Writing System            Page 16


            original state and starts over with the INIT handler and
            EXIT causes an immediate exit back to the operating system.

              (SAVE)            save the current game position
              (RESTORE)         restore a saved game position

            These functions allow the player to save and restore
            positions in the game.  They prompt the player for a file
            name and either read a saved game position from the file or
            write the current game position to the file.

              (function-name expr*)

            This expression invokes a user defined function.  There
            should be one expression for each of the formal arguments of
            the user function.  The value of the expression is the value
            of the last expression in the body of the user function or
            the value passed to a RETURN statement within the function.

              (SEND object selector [expr]*)

            This expression sends a message to an object.  The "object"
            expression should evaluate to an object.  The selector
            should match a method selector for that object or one of its
            super-classes.  The matching method is invoked with the
            specified expressions as arguments.  Also, the implied
            argument SELF will refer to the object receiving the
            message.

              (SEND-SUPER selector [expr]*)

            This expression sends a message to the super-class of the
            current object.  It can only be used within a method and it
            will cause the message to be passed up the class heirarchy
            to the super-class of the object refered to by SELF.

              (SETQ variable value)

            This expression sets the value of a user variable.

              (COND [(test expr*)]*)            execute conditionally
              (IF test then-expr [else-expr])   traditional if-then-else
              (WHILE test expr*)                conditional iteration
              (PROGN expr*)                     block construct
              (RETURN [expr])                   return from a function

            These statements are control constructs.

        Primary expressions:

            integer             (digits preceeded by an optional sign)
            string              (characters enclosed in double quotes)
            action-name         (an action name)
            object-name         (an object or class name)
            property-name       (a property name)
            constant-name       (a defined constant or function)
            variable-name       (a variable name)

            Since an adventure description contains a large quantity of
            running text, the format for specifying string constants is
            somewhat extended from normal programming languages.  In
            this system, a string is enclosed in double quotes.  If the
            end of line occurs before the closing quote within a string,
            it is treated as if it were a space.  Any number of
            consecutive spaces is collapsed into a single space.  Also,
            the character pair "\n" is used to represent the "end of
            line" character, the pair "\t" is used to represent the tab
            character and the pair "\\" is used to represent the
            backslash character.

          Examples:

                "This is a string.\n"
                "This
                 is
                 a
                 string.\n"

            Both of the examples above represent the same string.
